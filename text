I have been doing competitive climbing for 8.5 years but have been climbing for 9.5 years. I used to train on Team Waimea, but recently moved teams and joined Team Central Rock Gym Stoneham. I also have been part of the Andover High School Color Guard since 8th grade(2016)


I am very interested in going into a career in sports medicine related physical therapy. I got interested in it, because I injured my shoulder from climbing during my freshman year, and if I had gone to physical therapy my shoulder may have healed correctly. However, now it is permanently out of alignment. I also would like to become a certified masseuse, yoga instructor, and personal trainer. 


My goals for the future, are to be the head coach of a competitive youth rock climbing team, lead people to fitness goals through personal training, become a physical therapist for athletes, and travel the world for fun and for climbing.
